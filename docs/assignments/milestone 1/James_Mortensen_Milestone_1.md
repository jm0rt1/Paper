# Milestone 1
Group Members: James Mortensen


## Introduction: 

The goal of this project is to build upon the work done in a previous software engineering course, CSE 682, to create a more sophisticated stock analysis system. The existing system is capable of obtaining stock data but lacks the data analysis tools necessary to derive meaningful insights.

To overcome this limitation, this project proposes to incorporate machine learning techniques to handle data preprocessing and curation. Although the team has limited familiarity with the subject matter, a machine learning model can be trained to effectively predict intrinsic stock value.

Our objective is to improve the existing system by implementing machine learning algorithms that can process and analyze financial data. This will enable us to extract valuable insights and make more accurate predictions about a company's performance and future prospects.

## Team roles and responsibilities:

This is a single member team, consisting of:

## Project goals and objectives: 

The goal of the project is to determine a fair valuation of a company using machine learning. It may also be possible to predict the expected rate of return based on past data.

Stock Market Data is available through many API's. An API that works particularly well is AlphaVantage. Data can be obtained from AlphaVanatage and be handled and passed into a machine learning model to gain insights

## Project scope:

The goal of this project is to design and build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the intrinsic value of stocks based on fundamental financial data. The model will take in a range of financial inputs, including balance sheet data, income statement data, and cash flow data, and output an estimated intrinsic value for each stock.

## Data sources: 

The main data source will be the AlphaVantage API, but the following data sources are also acceptable if additional data is needed:

1. Public financial databases: There are many public financial databases that provide historical financial data for companies listed on major stock exchanges. Examples of such databases include Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Quandl.

2. Company reports: Many publicly traded companies release quarterly or annual financial reports that include information on their financial performance. These reports can be obtained from the company's website or through financial news sources.

3. Financial news sources: Financial news sources such as Bloomberg, Reuters, and CNBC provide up-to-date financial news and data on companies and markets. This data can be used to supplement financial data obtained from other sources.

4. Financial APIs: Many financial data providers offer APIs that can be used to access real-time financial data on companies and markets. Examples of such APIs include Alpha Vantage, Intrinio, and Xignite.

5. Crowdsourced data: There are also crowdsourced platforms, such as Estimize, that collect financial estimates and forecasts from a community of analysts and investors. This data can be used to supplement traditional financial data sources and improve the accuracy of the model.

## Potential challenges:

1. Data availability and quality: One of the biggest challenges in any data-related project is obtaining high-quality data. It is possible the identified data sources may not be sufficient after investigating the topic further

2. Technical issues: Depending on the complexity of this project, it may face technical challenges such as hardware or software limitations, compatibility issues, or implementation difficulties. It is possible that the tools we use may not be sufficient for the task.

3. Time constraints: Preprocessing or curating large datasets can be time-consuming and may require significant computational resources. It is important to budget enough time and resources to complete the project.

4. Knowledge and expertise: Preprocessing and curation techniques can be complex and require specialized knowledge and expertise. It is important to have a strong understanding of the relevant techniques and tools before starting the project.
