Yes, the example provided uses a single historical data point for each stock's financial metrics (value investing characteristics) to predict the corresponding stock returns. In practice, using just one historical data point may not be sufficient to make accurate predictions, as financial markets are dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors.

To improve the predictive power of your models, you could consider the following approaches:

1. **Feature engineering:** Create additional features derived from the existing value investing characteristics or incorporate other financial metrics and market indicators that could influence stock returns.

2. **Time-series analysis:** Instead of using a single data point, you can analyze historical data points over a period of time to capture trends and patterns in the stock returns. Time-series analysis techniques, such as autoregressive models or recurrent neural networks, can be useful for this purpose.

3. **Incorporate macroeconomic factors:** Financial markets are also influenced by macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth. Incorporating macroeconomic data into your analysis can help capture some of these external influences on stock returns.

4. **Combine multiple models:** Ensemble learning techniques, such as stacking or bagging, can be employed to combine the predictions of multiple models, potentially improving the overall predictive performance.

Remember that the quality of your predictions is heavily dependent on the quality and relevance of the input data. Using a larger dataset with a longer historical range and including additional relevant features can lead to more accurate and reliable predictions. However, it's essential to be mindful of overfitting and the limitations of historical data when using machine learning models to predict stock returns.
