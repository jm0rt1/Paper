# Title: Enhancing Value Investing Performance through Preprocessing and Curation Techniques

## Author: Jamie Mortensen

### Abstract
The paper presents the design and implementation of a preprocessing and curation process that enhances the performance of value investing strategies. We experiment with various language models and technologies to identify the most effective approach. The experimental paper spans 3,000 words, discussing background, experimental design, results, and related research. The code and datasets are submitted as part of the project for reproducibility.
