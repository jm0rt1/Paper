# The predicted values are the estimated stock returns based on the value investing
# characteristics of the stocks in the test set. These predictions are generated by
# the trained machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network)
# using the relationships they have learned between the value investing characteristics
# and the stock returns during the training phase.
#
# Each element in the predictions array corresponds to the predicted stock return
# for a specific stock in the test set. The idea is that by using the value investing
# characteristics, the models attempt to estimate the future returns of these stocks.
#
# In the context of value investing, these predicted returns can help investors
# identify potentially undervalued or overvalued stocks based on their value characteristics.
# However, it's important to remember that these predictions are only estimates and
# should not be considered as guarantees of actual future returns. They are based on
# historical relationships in the data, which may not always hold true in the future.
#
# It's also worth noting that the example provided uses a synthetic dataset, so the
# predicted values do not have any real-world meaning. For meaningful predictions,
# you should use a real dataset with historical financial data and stock returns.
